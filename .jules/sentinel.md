## 2024-05-23 - Hardcoded Secret Key
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` with a default value in Pydantic Settings class.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secrets in code pose a high security risk as they can be easily leaked or committed to version control.
**Prevention:** Make sensitive configuration values required fields in Pydantic Settings by removing default values. This forces the application to load them securely from environment variables or `.env` files and prevents the app from starting with insecure defaults.

## 2024-05-24 - Hardcoded Database Credentials
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and default `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in Pydantic Settings class.
**Learning:** Hardcoded database credentials or API keys pose a critical security risk and can lead to unauthorized access if committed to version control.
**Prevention:** Make sensitive configuration values required fields in Pydantic Settings by removing default values. This forces the application to load them securely from environment variables or `.env` files.
