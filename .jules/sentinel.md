## 2024-05-23 - Hardcoded Database Credentials in Pydantic Config
**Vulnerability:** The `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` was hardcoded to a default value in the `Settings` class (`backend/app/core/config.py`).
**Learning:** Hardcoding credentials in source code exposes them to anyone with repository access. Even if intended for local development, it can leak to production.
**Prevention:** Rely on `pydantic_settings` to inject secrets via environment variables by defining the variable type without providing a default value.
